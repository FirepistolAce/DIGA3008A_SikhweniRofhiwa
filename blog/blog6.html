    <header>week 6</header> Design Section Style guides The homepage picture I used had a huge
    influence on the color scheme I chose. I want to relay a feeling of
    familiarity, warmth, nostalgia, and new beginnings, similar to how Naruto,
    the kid character above, felt when he went on his first journey with his
    sensei/master Jiraya. Although initially, I had orange and red in mind for
    the color scheme, soon after testing them, I reconsidered my choice as they
    did not go well with my other colors. Dark Navy Blue – #0D0D2B Teal Blue –
    #0F4C5C Cyan/Teal – #009E9E Sea Green – #54B578 Light Green – #A1D95C Now
    when it comes to the font styles I aimed to use, a lot of thought went into
    my choices from the previous options I had in mind those being the generic
    writing fonts like Times New Roman and Arial font but with the help of AI a
    bit, I concluded three possible fonts that would be more ideal for my
    website style and color pallet. Poppins – A modern, geometric sans-serif
    font that gives a sleek and stylish feel. It works great for headers and
    body text. Playfair Display – A serif font that adds an elegant and
    sophisticated touch. You can use it for headings while keeping a sans-serif
    for body text. Montserrat – A bold and contemporary sans-serif font, perfect
    for a clean and structured look. It's great for both headers and body
    content. 20250324_160328.jpg20250324_160150.jpg For the user flow, there
    hasn't been any drastic change in how I want my users to interact with my
    website. But one thing to note is that I will remove the buttons, from my
    previous wireframes, since after close consideration and feedback it was
    advised to do so, I have direct links and buttons all on the same page, and
    although I believed they were serving different tasks, in the overall grand
    scheme of thing they were just doing what other was doing. References All
