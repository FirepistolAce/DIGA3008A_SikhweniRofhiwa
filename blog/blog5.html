    My goal for this website remains the same to create a website that is easily
    user-friendly and accessible, whilst being unique and enticing at the same
    time. Now I do acknowledge that this goal could change with time as I build
    my website and grow and develop on my journey as a web designer. As for my
    information structure, I opted for a more generic and simple way of
    displaying my information which is why I structured my pages in a way that
    guides the user to having a smooth experience, by having my pages start from
    Profile where the user reads about the creator of the website, then to the
    portfolio to see some of my works. After that it is the design page where
    the user will get some insights on the design insights I had to make for my
    website, then lastly it will be the blogs and essay pages will provide the
    user with a step-by-step explanation of the design journey of my website
    along with all the adversities I had to face.

    When it comes to the user flow
    of the website, I want there to be clarity straight from the homepage as to
    what the user must interact with and how to do so. Starting with the display
    of headers on every relevant page the user is going to be on so that they
    know which page they are on and what they should expect. Now on the top of
    every page, I aim to have the direct link to the other relevant pages so
    that the user has freedom of choice as to choose which page they want to
    start with rather than feeling forced to go through a specific page that
    does not spike their interest. Not only that but also at the bottom of each
    page I will have a button linking the current page either to the next page
    or the previous page so that there is a sense of order.
</p>
<p>
    Now at some point, I
    will have to either choose the buttons or direct links as keeping both kind
    of seems a bit reductant. But at the current time, they serve two different
    purposes as one is there to take the user directly to the page they want
    hence the content they want to see whereas the other is there to link the
    pages in the above direct link displayed way so that it improves the user
    flow. Reference Wireframe.cc (n.d.) Wireframe.cc â€“ Minimal wireframing tool.
