      Page 1 of 6 Essay 1 : UX & UI Analysis Figure1 (AVIJOZI, 2025) shows the
      presentation section at the function. AVOJOZI is a creative industry
      festival or event that takes place in Johannesburg South Africa every
      year, hence its name. It aims to connect technicians, animators, writers,
      artist and more not just on a local scale but on a global scale too. Its
      website above is the perfect example of a well-constructed website that
      has great UI and UX. User Interface (UI) is the point of human and
      computer interaction as well as communication in a device. This includes
      display screens, keyboards, a mouse, and the appearance of one’s desktop,
      (Rouse, n.d.). All the above mentioned and more allow the user to interact
      with an application or website, through visual and audio elements. User
      Interaction (UX) on the other hand is the overall experience a user has
      when interacting with a system, product, or service. This encompasses the
      entire process from initial contact and awareness to post usage, focusing
      on the user’s perspective and feelings brought about the entire process.
      Lastly ethics often called moral philosophy are the moral principles that
      govern a person’s behaviour or decision, in the context of web development
      and design this focuses on specificity when one situates themselves in
      their current society. This essay aims to prove that Interaction on the
      web is structured through the UI and UX. A good starting point for this
      premise should be, what makes a reliable website, alongside with, when to
      spot good UI and UX design choices. To answer the first question, we need
      to look at if a website has the following, usability, privacy, security,
      transparency, accessibility, inclusion, safety, ethical persuasion, and
      sustainability. All of which are referred to as the principles of web
      design. These principles of web design draw upon UI to take effect.
      AVIJOZI’s website encapsulates most of the above principles very well. The
      website is designed in such a way that it is not dull, but rather eye
      captivating as it draws your attention to it. This is shown in how easy it
      is to navigate the website; the layout is simple yet effective. From the
      moment you are introduced into the home screen there is a clear objective
      to entertain and gasp your attention with the colour pallet. It looks and
      feels legit; they highlight information which looks credible and relevant
      not to mention they provide all the necessary whereabout and know about on
      how to contact them. Now another aspect which they executed very well is
      the inclusion part, where even though this website is not everyone’s cup
      of tea it does contain content for different people. May it be dying hard
      core game enthusiasts and animation admires or just your average event
      lover AVIJOZI has you covered. Figure 2 (AVIJOZI, 2025) navigation bar
      Figure 3(AVIJOZI, 2025) highlights the different genres of work. Figure
      4(AVIJOZI, 2025) the roadmap to get to the venue. Now although that does
      make the website compelling, lets come to the back hand part of it. The UX
      design principles used in the above website. It does not take a rocket
      scientist to see that a lot of thought and care into the responsive design
      of this website. From the super-fast navigation and its responsiveness
      when hovering above it, or down to the gallery and speaker line-up. With
      all that said one cannot help noticing the lack of distinction on the
      website as the website stays consistent throughout, and although that
      works for them, I cannot help it but feel they played it safe by not
      incorporating something that stands out. An effective way to implement
      this would be to use The Von Restorff effect. Figure 5 (AVIJOZI, 2025)
      Exhibition. Figure 6 (AVIJOZI, 2025) sponsors. This would benefit a lot of
      the other pages on the website, by having some icons or sections that
      slightly are different in colour shape or size than the rest of the design
      choices they made would make their website that much more memorable.
      Another point to note is that there is a sheer number of overwhelming
      choices they user or viewer ius presented with from the moment they
      interact with the homepage, it just be the nav bar or where to go next in
      terms of information. As eighty percent of the website composes of images,
      and although they serve distinct functions while going through them, I
      could not help but feel as if they were a bit redundant. I feel like some
      of the choices they could have simplified further even though in their own
      way they thought they were making things simple for viewers. A prime
      example of this would be to strip off the “contact us” option from the
      navigation bar and just have it stay fixed in the footer, because it is
      really confusing as in some pages there is contact information at the very
      bottom of the page. Thus, it can be confusing at times when finding your
      way across the website, hence this also affects viewer’s attention span as
      they are more likely to leave the site before they get to the important
      sections of the website. Imagine someone who is not a digital art lover
      clicking onto the website and having a bumpy experience, they are most
      likely to exit the site as they may not feel compelled to continue due to
      the loss of interest brought about the way the website is structured.
      Figure 7 (AVIJOZI, 2025) contacts and footer Not to take away from the
      good they did, because there are some superior design choices, the
      optimization, sizing and spacing of the information they wan you to know,
      as the icons/ shapes are bigger and pop up more and highlighted by crisp
      short animations. This comes back to one of the principles of web design,
      which is ethical personation, because by doing what I just mention, they
      can manage to influence the viewer to visiting their certain pages more
      than the rest because that’s is where they want majority of their traffic
      to go. The thing that I will give them props for is their positioning as
      they did an impeccable job at that. People are not less likely to read
      content that is in a zig zag line versus if something is centred , And
      they nailed it as which ever page you may navigate to the contents of that
      page will always be centred, making the viewer’s experience that much more
      better. Overall, AVIJOZI’s website does a solid job of showing how UI and
      UX work together to shape the way we interact online. From how the layout
      pulls your attention in, to how the animations and icons guide your
      journey across the site, there was a plan behind how everything was built.
      But even though a lot of the design choices work well, there are still
      areas that could be improved to make the user experience smoother and more
      memorable. Things like simplifying options, being more selective with
      visuals, and adding standout elements would help the site go from good to
      great. The balance between function and style is there, it just needs a
      bit more risk and clarity in some places to really push the experience
      forward. As I conclude I would say that based upon the above point, the
      use of good or bad UI and UX can make or break one’s website. This was
      seen by how well AVIJOZI’s website excels in a lot of the UI elements but
      because they played it safe with their UX its kind or made their website a
      bit expected. They had all the tools to make the user experience something
      exciting, but instead, they stuck to what works without taking any bold
      steps. That is not a dreadful thing, but it does leave the site feeling a
      bit too safe at times. A little more creativity in the way information is
      shown or how users move through the pages could have made a significant
      difference. Still, they managed to create a platform that is clear, easy
      to use, and visually strong—which proves that UI and UX do not just
      support a website, they shape the whole experience. Word count = 1300
